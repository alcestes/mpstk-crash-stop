# mpstk - the MultiParty Session Types toolKit with crash-stop failure modelling

mpstk is a toolkit for **specifying multiparty protocols** and
**verifying their properties** (e.g., deadlock-freedom and liveness).

This version of mpstk is based on the **generalised theory of multiparty
session types** with **crash-stop failures**, presented in the companion paper:

*  Adam D. Barwell, Alceste Scalas, Nobuko Yoshida, and Fangyi Zhou.
   Generalised Multiparty Session Types with Crash-Stop Failures.
   CONCUR 2022.

The original version of mpstk (available at https://github.com/alcestes/mpstk)
is based on the following paper:

*  Alceste Scalas and Nobuko Yoshida.
   [Less is More: Multiparty Session Types Revisited](https://doi.org/10.1145/3290343).
